[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Graffiti is a interprted and compiled language written in Ocaml.

- Type graffiti code
- See the AST
- âœ¨Visualize walking the AST in real time
- Look at the byte code being produced!
## Features
- Primitives (integers, booleans, strings, arrays, hashes)
- Conditionals
- First class functons
- Closusers, (Inteprted only)

## In Progress

This is designed to be a learning language, so I want the compiler to be able to output a well structured Abstract Syntax Tree, Easy to read bytecode and a visual way to see the program walk the ast or bytecode.

> The cmdline tool will let you either compile 
> or interpret it, as well as output an AST or the ByteCode.
> The idea is to visualize the inher workings of a 
> Programming language

For many it is a mystery how programming languages work, the goal of this project was to demistify that for myself as well as share what I learned with other, additionaly I wanted to learn more about functional programming and ocaml seemed like a great choice.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Ocaml] - An industrial-strength functional programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety 
- [Alcotest] - Alcotest exposes a simple interface to perform unit tests
- [xxhash] - xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, processing at RAM speed limits.


## Installation

*TODO* Add install instructions for Nix and then everyone else

```sh
cd dillinger
nix shell graffiti
graffiti --version
```

- [d3-visualizer]
- [clean-formatter]
- [sql-query]
- [Gleam]

## Development

Open your terminal

### issues

- [ ] Evaluater is a mess of recursive functions need more modular formatting
- [ ] Need to add mli files for all ml files with proper name space exposure
- [ ] Reversing let statements but not block statements very weird
- [ ] Refractoring to results and options instead of failswith (asserts arent bad honostly for dev phase)
- [ ] Make every failswith return a Result instead of a runtime error return an error object using Result by Ocaml

#### future plans
- STEP 1: Finish the compiler and interpreter as well as a useful cmdline utility to use both (repl, ast outpus, bytecode output)
- STEP 2: Website with lang info as well as breif tutorial
- STEP 3: AST visualizer
- STEP 4: Bytecode visualizer


* Add less than or equal to and greater than respectively
* Make the langugage installable on Nix systems via the flake in your github
* Add the langugae to this project [monkeys in the wild](https://github.com/mrnugget/monkeylang/?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-new-implementation)
* Do a nix build of the language so that it can be installed with the flake 
* Monkey logo modification
* Macros sections
* CMD line interprter to run commands
* .ape file extensions
* custom lsp for this toy langugae
* instructions for running the language
* Add a CI/CD script to auto run tests on push
* Like gleam create a tutorial to learn the language

### standards
#### Copiler Must Have

* Always have mli files
* Always have internal documentation
* Always have tail call optimization checks
* Always remove all warning silencers before release
* No exceptions only use Results and Result.bind



#### Building for source
